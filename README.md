# lib_rf_stm32f1
Establish a wireless data transmission and reception system between two STM32 microcontrollers (STM32F103 and STM32F407) using RF modules operating at the 2.4GHz radio frequency band (e.g., nRF24L01).

## üîå Hardware Requirements

| Device             | Quantity |
|--------------------|----------|
| STM32F103C8T6      | 1        |
| STM32F407VGT6      | 1        |
| nRF24L01+ Module   | 2        |
| 3.3V Regulated Power Supply | 2 |
| Jumper Wires       | Several  |
| Capacitor 10¬µF     | 2 (optional but recommended) |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** nRF24L01+ modules are sensitive to unstable voltage. Ensure a clean 3.3V supply with decoupling capacitors near the VCC/GND pins.

## üîó Wiring (SPI Interface)

| nRF24L01+ | STM32 Pin (example) |
|-----------|---------------------|
| VCC       | 3.3V                |
| GND       | GND                 |
| CE        | PA0                 |
| CSN       | PA4 (SPI_NSS)       |
| SCK       | PA5 (SPI_SCK)       |
| MISO      | PA6 (SPI_MISO)      |
| MOSI      | PA7 (SPI_MOSI)      |
| IRQ       | Not connected       |

‚úÖ You can change CE/CSN pins by modifying the `nrf24l01p.c/h` configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build and Flash Instructions

1. Open STM32CubeIDE.
2. Import `Rf_f1` and `Rf_f4` as separate projects.
3. Connect each board via ST-Link or USB and build the project.
4. Flash each firmware to the correct board:
   - `Rf_f1` ‚Üí STM32F103 (Transmitter)
   - `Rf_f4` ‚Üí STM32F407 (Receiver)
5. Open UART terminal on PC to monitor receiver output.

## üß™ Expected Behavior

- **F103** sends a data packet periodically (e.g., `"Hello F4"`).
- **F407** receives the packet and prints it to UART.
- You can verify the result using PuTTY, TeraTerm, or Serial Monitor at 115200 baud.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Add two-way communication
- Support for more payload types (e.g., sensor data)
- Interrupt-based RX handling
- Use of FreeRTOS
- Display received data on OLED or LCD
